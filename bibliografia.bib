	abstract = {Smart canes are usually developed to alert visually challenged users of any obstacles beyond the canes' physical lengths. The accuracy of the sensors and their actuators' positions are equally crucial to estimate the locations of the obstacles with respect to the users so as to ensure only correct signals are sent through the associated audio or tactile feedbacks. For implementations with low-cost sensors, however, the users are very likely to get false alerts due to the effects from noise and their erratic readings, and the performance degradation will be more noticeable when the positional fluctuations of the actuators get amplified. In this paper, a multi-sensor obstacle detection system for a smart cane is proposed via a model-based state-feedback control strategy to regulate the detection angle of the sensors and minimize the false alerts to the user. In this approach, the overall system is first restructured into a suitable state-space model, and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based controller is then synthesized to further optimize the actuator's control actions while ensuring its position tracking. We also integrate dynamic feedback compensators into the design to increase the accuracy of the user alerts. The performance of the resulting feedback system was evaluated via a series of real-time experiments, and we showed that the proposed method provides significant improvements over conventional methods in terms of error reductions.},

@article{Dakopoulos2010,
	abstract = {The last decades a variety of portable or wearable navigation systems have been developed to assist visually impaired people during navigation in known or unknown, indoor or outdoor environments. There are three main categories of these systems: electronic travel aids (ETAs), electronic orientation aids (EOAs), and position locator devices (PLDs). This paper presents a comparative survey among portable/wearable obstacle detection/avoidance systems (a subcategory of ETAs) in an effort to inform the research community and users about the capabilities of these systems and about the progress in assistive technology for visually impaired people. The survey is based on various features and performance parameters of the systems that classify them in categories, giving qualitative-quantitative measures. Finally, it offers a ranking, which will serve only as a reference point and not as a critique on these systems.},

	abstract = {Cane is a tool that used by blind people or someone who has visually impaired which is caused by an accident or an illness. Cane helps the blind people to check whether there are any obstacles around them. However, before doing the research, we conducted a questionnaire to the blind people about what kind of extension module that would be implemented on their cane. Based-on the result, they need an extension smart tools for their cane that can give information about hitch, obstacle, hole, and also the direction of compass wind position to guide their way and also inform them Qibla direction. This research designed a prototype named Smart Guide Extension that can detect obstacles, holes and give information about eights wind direction using Arduino. The obstacles and holes module uses 2 PING Sensors, while the 8 direction of the wind information uses CMP compass sensor 511. All the information will be informed through the sound. The results of testing the obstacle data module stated that the buzzer will be active at a distance of 150 cm-3 cm and the speed of beep sound faster from 1.1 until 0.3 seconds. The test holes modules state that the beep sound active at a distance of 10-50 cm. The system can detect eight direction of the compass wind position with deviation angle position about ±3°. Based on the questionnaire of trial prototype to the responder, 77.38{\%} of responder stated these tools are user friendly and easily to used.},

	abstract = {An efficient reintegration of the disabled people in the family and society should be fulfilled; hence it is strongly needful to assist their diminished functions or to replace the totally lost functions. Assistive technology helps in neutralizing the impairment. Recent advancements in embedded systems have opened up a vast area of research and development for affordable and portable assistive devices for the visually impaired. Granted there are many assistive devices on the market that are able to detect obstacles, and numerous research and development currently in process to alleviate the cause, unfortunately the cost of devices, size of devices, intrusiveness and higher learning curve prevents the visually impaired from taking advantage of available devices. This project aims at the design and implementation of a detachable unit which is robust, low cost and user friendly, thus, trying to aggrandize the functionality of the existing white cane, to concede above-knee obstacle detection. The designed obstruction detector uses ultrasound sensors for detecting the obstructions before direct contact. It bestows haptic feedback to the user in accordance with the position of the obstacle.},

The distance between the obstacle and the user is sent to an Android device via Bluetooth. The user gets voice alerts about the distance through Bluetooth headset.

@article{Therib2017,
	abstract = {In this work, a device is designed and implemented that it is doing three jobs in order to help blind people to walk without accidents may occur. The first proposed one is accomplished by putting the ultrasonic sensor in a measured angle about 40o on a suitable blinding stick to detect if there is a hole or stair in front of blind at about 48 cm distance to prevent him from falling and as a result may be causing many injuries. The second one uses a moisture sensor in the first leg of the four legs stick to measure the degree of the land soil moisture in front of the blind and alert him when that degree exceeds a measured level that may immerse the feet of him. While, the third one is made by using another ultrasonic sensor on the stick to turn an alarm ON when there is an obstacle, person, or wall at a small distance about 50 cm near him to prevent a collision accident. The stick is implemented practically using four leg blinding cane, Arduino microcontroller and the three sensors. Also, the three buzzers and one vibrator motor and three LEDs are used on the stick to turn on when a such problems occur. The device gives good results when many visually impaired people in Merjan medical city in Babylon used it.},
